    "\n",
    "This dataset contains iTRAQ proteomics data for over 12,000 proteins in 77 breast cancer samples and 3 healthy breast samples. The samples used in this data set were collected by the Clinical Proteomic Tumour Analysis Consortium.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to narrow the scope of the data, our group will be looking at the top 10 most highly expressed proteins in tumors that are at AJCC stage III or higher. AJCC staging is the Cancer Staging System developed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer, that classifies the severity of cancer with regards to the primary tumor and can be used to show the extent in which the cancer has spread. This tool is helpful for determining a prognosis and can serve as the basis for developing the most effective treatment plan on an individual basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are investigating whether the protein expression of the top 10 most highly expressed proteins in tumors that are AJCC stage III or higher can accurately predict and classify the AJCC stage of breast cancer."
